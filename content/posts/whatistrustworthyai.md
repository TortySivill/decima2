## Why Do We Trust?

Trust is an abstract concept which varies widely across circumstances and individuals. However, it is udeniable that humans have historically trusted other humans wuth high stakes decisions. Why do we trust doctors to make us better or judges to determine criminal guilt? 

Over generations of societies, humans have relied on accountability to foster trust in governing systems. However, with the advent of technology, these hierarchies of trust are beginning to change...

## Would You Trust an AI Over a Human?

It has been found in multiple recent studies that humans are more likely to trust decisions made my machines rather than humans. People assume that machines are intentionless in their decision making and are thereforwe less biased and fairer than humans. 

## Do YOU Trust AI?

If you answered yes to the question above, let me try to change your mind...

<it> It's Friday afternoon and you're eagerly anticipating 5pm, you're off on holiday tomorrow. As you're getting the Tube home, you catch a glimpse of the Metro headline:
       
 NEW CREDIT SYSTEM REVOLUTIONISES THE WAY WE PAY: NO MORE QUEUES!
        
You're sceptical but don't think twice, you can already feel the sand between your toes. Saturday morning arrives and when you get to the airport you notice the new automated doors. They look like passport control gates. Strange, that must be the new credit system, shouldn't be a problem I've always paid my taxes, you reassure yourself. The gates turn green and open as the person in front of you passes through without a problem. As the laser scans over your face, you appreciate the magic of technology, No more fraud, no more queues, this is fantastic! But the light turns red and you are denied access. What, why? You're outraged as it becomes increasingly clear you will not be going on holiday. How dare an AI refuse your holiday with no explanation. </it>

If this happened to you. Would you trust that AI passport control had made the right decision?

The story above sounds dystopian, like the opening to a 1970s science fiction novel, yet it bares striking similarity to China's ongoing experiment in social credit. Other recent events, including the fatal driverless car crash in Arizona in 2018 and the racial bias embedded in a US recidivism algorithm exposed by ProPublica illuminate untrustworthy behaviour of high stakes technology. 


## Untrustworthy AI 

While machines are inanimate objects and possess no intentions of their own, AI models depend completely on humans for data and development
which encodes human biases into these systems. These biases are encoded unintentionally, which, when coupled with the fact that AI is becoming so complex it cannot be understood by any human, not even those who develop it, means that we end up with AI models which we cannot trust. 

We have no idea why the automated passport gate denies or grants access, and we don't know if it is using some unfair learned bias to determine its outcome. We should not blindly trust this AI system, just because it is a machine. 

## Developing Trustwworthy AI 

Building AI systems which we can trust is just as complex as defining trust. However, Trustworthy AI is a research discipline which attempts to find solutions to the above problems.
