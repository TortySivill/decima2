## Defining AI 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of a machine to recreate human behaviour. Machine Learning (which describes algorithms like neaural networks) is a subset of AI. 

## Machines or Brains?

Machine Learning replicates the human ability to learn from experience. A Neural Network algorithm constructs a network of nodes whose connections act like the nuerons in our brain.

When we ask our algorithm to perfom a task, distinguish between images of cats and dogs for example,  we feed a large number of examples into the network which uses different layers of nodes to learn the patterns and rules which help to differentiate the images. The network may use the first layer of nodes to learn that cats have whiskers but dogs don't. Nowadays, neural networks often have millions, even billions of internal nodes! This allows them to learn more complex behaviour than simply identifying cats and dogs.
