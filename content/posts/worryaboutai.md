## The Wonders of AI
As AI becomes increasingly complex it can be used to improve the lives of humans. This includes automating decision making processes such as identifying cancerous cells from radiography images to autonomous tractors, to deomocratizing education in remote areas. 


## AI and Bias 
However, just as humans can be flawed in their decision making, AI has also been known to get it wrong. As AI requires a large number of real world examples to learn from it is vulnerable to learn harmful societal biases inherent in this data. For example, the ChatGPT example below shows how the AI has learnt that men have historically been more likely to be builders than women and has used that bias to inform its decision making..

Unfortunately, as AI is now so complex, humans have no way of knowing what kind of patterns the AI is learning to make its decisions. We would never know, for example, if the neural network was indeed using whiskers to differentiate between cats and dogs. As we are unable to validate the behaviour of AI, we cannot trust its decision making. 

AI has the potential to make life better, capable of making faster and more accurate decisions. However, until we are able to trust an AI's decision we cannot confidently
