## Rubbish Data, Rubbish AI
People often say "a model is only ever as good as its data". This statement rings absolutely true when we are talking about Untrustworthy AI. AI models, by definiton require data as input to the algorithm. The model then learns patterns from this data in dimensions higher than the brain can understand. Imagine an anagram puzzle, its often easier to write out the letters of the anagram in several configurations until your brain finally solves the puzzle! This is exactly how AI models use data, and scramble and unscramble it into various configurations, until they find a pattern. These models then use these patterns to make predictions. If we put rubbish data into these models then we must expect rubbish predictions. If we put untrustworthy data into these models then we must expect untrustworthy predictions.

## How Can Data Be Untrustworthy?

## Not Enough Data

## The Dangers of Data Collection 

## Imbalanced Data

## Biased Data 
As data represents historical behaviour of a system of interest, when that system of interest is humans, we know that bias exists in human historical systems - therefore we know that our data will also reflect this bias.
